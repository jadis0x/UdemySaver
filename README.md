# UdemySaver
UdemySaver is a lightweight C++ application that lets you download Udemy courses you own for offline use.
It ships with a small HTTP server and a modern web UI so you can browse your library, queue downloads, and monitor progress from your browser.

## Features
- View your Udemy course library in a responsive web UI.
- Start and monitor download queues for individual lectures or entire courses.
- Automatically organizes downloaded files under a `downloads/` directory.
- Cross-platform build via CMake.

# Requirements
| Tool/Library           | Notes                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| C++20 compiler         | MSVC / Clang / GCC        |
| CMake â‰¥ 3.8            | Build system              |
| Boost (system, thread, beast) | Networking primitives     |
| libcurl                | HTTP requests & downloads |
| nlohmann\_json         | JSON parsing              |

## Configuration
Create a settings.ini alongside the executable:
```bash
# UdemySaver settings
udemy_access_token=PASTE_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
udemy_api_base=https://www.udemy.com
# http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8080   ; optional
```
You can also start the program without a token and paste it via the web interface; the file will be created automatically.

## Obtaining the access token

1. Log in to Udemy in your browser.
2. Open the developer tools (F12) and head to the Application/Storage tab.
3. Under **Cookies** for `www.udemy.com`, copy the value of `access_token`.
4. Use this value in `settings.ini` or paste it into the web UI when prompted.

## Usage

1. Run the application:

```bash
./UdemySaver
```

2. Open a browser at <http://127.0.0.1:8080>.
3. If prompted, paste your Udemy access token.
4. Browse your library, choose a course, and click **Download**.
5. Files are saved under a `downloads/` directory.
